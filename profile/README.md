# 👋 Welcome to DANDI Compute!

This is an upcoming experimental service for running a limited number of pre-approved data processing pipelines directly on DANDI Datasets - for free!

All you need to do is upload your data to the DANDI Archive.

Currently, this service only includes the [AIND ephys pipeline](https://aind-ephys-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for spike sorting.
- See their publication for more details: [Efficient and reproducible pipelines for spike sorting large-scale electrophysiology data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.12.687966v1).



## Roadmap

This feature is currently in **closed alpha**.

The planned stages are:
  - **closed alpha** - only internal testing within the team.
  - **closed beta** - only invited external users.
  - **open beta** - anyone who signed up to try it out with limits and may service may be pulled or disabled at any time.
  - **beta release** - open to the public but may experience major changes or be disabled at any time.
  - **full release** - open to the public.

The current timeline for progressing through these stages has not yet been decided.

If you would like to sign up for updates, please contact `info@dandiarchive.org` with the subject line `Request: Updates on DANDI-Compute`.



### DANDI Archive

Repositories contained in this GitHub organization are individual dandisets providing convenient access to TBs of neural data stored in the BRAIN Initiative [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org).
All individual Dandisets contained in this repository compose [dandi/dandisets](https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/) DataLad superdataset, which also provides code and tools to create and update individual Dandisets.
